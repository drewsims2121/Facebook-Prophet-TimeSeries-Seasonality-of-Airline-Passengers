# Facebook-Prophet-TimeSeries-Seasonality-of-Airline-Passengers
Using Facebook Prophet's Library to determine the seasonality of airplane passengers time series data

**The goal of this project is to determine whether a multiplicative or additive model would be better in determining seasonality upon trends in the airline passengers dataset**

**The Steps are as followed:**

**1.)** Import Libraries

**2.)** Import CSV Data

**3.)** Feature Engineer Date Column

**4.)** Create Prophet Model

**5.)** Visualize Prophet Model

**6.)** Explore Multiplicativeness of Seasonality
